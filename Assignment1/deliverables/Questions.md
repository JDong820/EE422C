Assignment 1 - Questions
========================

Input Questions
---------------

* Are we guaranteed that "QUIT" will be the last line?
* By "letters", do you refer to the characters represented by Unicode
code points U+0041-U+005a, inclusive and U+0061-U+007a, inclusive?
* What is the encoding of the input? UTF-7? UTF-16? Custom format?
* What is the desired output of the input "รกรกรก"? Specifically, should
diacritics be thrown out and "\u0061\u0300" be parsed as "a", or should both 
characters be thrown out?


Output Questions
----------------

* Is it acceptable to return an empty string due to the processing of "QUIT"
as input? Or should the program terminate output when it sees "QUIT"?
* What is the desired output format? Is it: `String.join(" ", resultStream)`?
i.e. Should there be space or newlines at the end?
* Is the desired output file `stdout` aka `System.out`?
* Should we report repeated palindromes? For example, should the input
"abaaba", produce the output "abaaba aba aba"?


Coding Questions
----------------

* Are there prohibited imports?
* What sort of APIs/tools can we expect the TAs to have? Apache Commons? Guava?
* Is use of StringBuffer instead of StringBuilder acceptable if presenting a
threaded solution?
* Are you a Single Entry Single Exit for Java person, and will you impose that
on us students?


Style Questions
---------------

* What naming conventions should we follow for Classes? Variables?
* Are you tolerant of `import java.util.*`? :)
* Which horizontal spacing is more preferable:
`if (null == new String ()) { System.out.println ("ok."); }` or
`if (null == new String()) { System.out.println("ok."); }`?
* Tabs or spaces? If spaces, how many?
* 79, 80, 100, or no character line limit?


Grading Questions
-----------------

* How will our project be built? Maven? If so, what is the POM that will be
used? Make? If so, what is the makefile that will be used? Apache ant? ... etc.
* What tools will grade our project? JUnit? STDOUT redirect to java?
* Are there other design requirements other than needing a `PalFinder.java`
file?
* Can we include custom build options, i.e. if the grader uses ant, we include
our own XML, if the grader uses Maven we include a POM, etc.?
